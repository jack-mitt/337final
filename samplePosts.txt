Title
N64 MINT CONDISH
Description
This is an OG N64 runs like a beaut. I cant stress how much I love this thing.
I have slept with it in my bed many times and sometimes even talk to it, so I need a new owner to treat it with
just as much respect. For example i typically take it out to dinner once a week so that is a good start.
I need to part ways because I need to pay for a mistake I made one night when I was drunk. Apparently
jumping the bar and mixing your own drinks to show a girl youre a mix master is frowned upon.

This bad boy was estimated to be worth 10 grand
on antiques road show but im out here selling it for 2. Im not gonna lie I stole it from
my grandma who was given it to her by her husband who died in the gulf war. I honestly just need the
money to buy a new whip. Im looking for a pimped out subaru so i guess id also trade for that.

Title
Tesla Model X 2015
Description
 'Bad ass whip. You pull up in this at any park all the
middle class moms will go crazy. Trust me i pulled some milfs just from going through family car
washes. Sadly im married now and have to part ways with my pussy wagon. The car is simply too
pimpin for my new family. I would feel so inclined to cheat that I cant even look at this car anymore.
Thats why I'm selling it for cheap. Full disclosure you will have to clean out the backseat. I had this one
chick back there who pounded three fish bowls before we left the hut. i knew she was gonna be down for the count
but when i saw her face when she saw those wing doors oooooo i knew i had to take her home. Needless to say she
puked before we made it to speedway. Like a lot literally nonstop all the way home. She was tood drunk to tell me
where she lived and i couldnt bring her into the house with my family so I let her sleep on the lawn and acted
surprised in the morning when her limp body traumatized my daughter. She was blacked last night so she didnt
recognize me so i took her home and we did the dirty and went about our business. That was on saturday so i have had
no time to clean the car. But it is too tempting for me to even get in again so im selling.
